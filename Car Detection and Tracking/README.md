#Project Car Detection and Tracking in CVAT

I have annotated a sequence of 32 images for Car Detection and Tracking using CVAT. The dataset was from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitkumargurjar/car-detection-and-tracking-dataset]. I have used bounding boxes in track mode to efficiently label the objects. Only one label, 'car' label was tagged since the dataset focuses on detecting and tracking cars on a highway.

Project Outcome:
- Annotated and tracked cars across 32 sequential images in CVAT, followed by a detailed quality control review of individual frames to correct inconsistent bounding box sizes and remove random appearance of bounding boxes annotations in some frames due to 'track' mode.
- Utilized 'Projection' feature for a still car throughout the 32 frames.
- Ensured consistency and accuracy in labeling the cars with bounding boxes.
