# Car Detection and Tracking of 32 sequential images

Training dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitkumargurjar/car-detection-and-tracking-dataset

Annotated 32 sequential images in CVAT to detect and track cars using bounding boxes (track mode), with a focus on consistency and accuracy. Conducted quality control to correct inconsistent box sizes (5+ frames). Exported in CVAT for Images XML format and documented for review and dataset reliability for computer vision applications.

#Project outcomes
- Utilized CVAT to annotate train dataset of Car Detection and Tracking from Kaggle | Utilized bounding boxes (track mode).
- Annotated and tracked cars across 32 sequential images in CVAT, followed by a detailed quality review by inspecting individual frames for inconsistent bounding box sizes (due to track mode variability) and correcting it by resizing the bounding box to fit each ‘car’ object accurately.
- Export format: CVAT for images 1.1
