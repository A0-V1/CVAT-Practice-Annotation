# CVAT-Practice-Annotation
Documentation for my CVAT practice annotation 

I've started learning about Data Annotation using CVAT tool - A computer vision tool for labeling visual data in image/video content to teach Machine Learning model classify different objects in images and videos.

#Learnings from my first data annotation project:
- Familiarization of CVAT tool interface.
- Developed foundational skills in data annotation for machine learning datasets by taking the CVAT’s YouTube Course.
- I created two labels: “person” and “car” and Bounding Box method was used for image labeling. Enhancing data annotation familiarity through CVAT.
- I Independently completed an image annotation project using CVAT, labeling an image with multiple objects (cars, persons) via bounding boxes method.
- There are some objects (i.e car, person) in the image that are occluded; Switch occuluded property was enabled.
